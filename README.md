**FaceFusion: Ethnic Feature Blending Diffusion Model**

---

## Overview

FaceFusion is an innovative machine learning project that generates synthetic facial images by blending features from different ethnic groups using a conditional diffusion model. The project aims to create realistic, diverse facial representations by combining characteristics from Oriental, Indian, and European ethnicities.

## Key Features

- üî¨ **Custom Class-Conditional UNet-based Diffusion Model**
- üåç **Multi-Ethnic Face Generation**
- üé® **Flexible Ethnic Feature Blending**
- üìä **Controllable Image Synthesis**

---

## Project Description

The goal of FaceFusion is to generate new faces by intelligently combining features from three distinct ethnic groups:

- **Orientals**
- **Indians**
- **White Europeans**

### Capabilities

- Generate up to **10 unique face images** for each ethnic combination
- Adjust class proportions dynamically (e.g., 50% Oriental, 50% Indian)
- Create faces representing multiple ethnic groups simultaneously
